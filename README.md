Wattzap Home Trainer Virtual Reality Software
=============================================

WattzAp enables home trainer users (turbo trainers, rollers) to record details of their workout, follow training programmes all within a
virtual reality environment.

WattzAp can:

  * display heart rate, cadence, rider speed and power both graphically and as real time data
  * follow workouts that target power, cadence and heart rate
  * synchronize the playback of compatible videos (Tacx RLV, Tacx TTS, Tacx Ergo, GPX, PWR) with your speed
  * share your results on sites such as Strava, SelfLoops etc
  
WattzAp works with standard turbo trainers and rollers. You don't need a complicated VR turbo trainer.
WattzAp is an open platform, you can create your own videos and workouts and share these with other users.

This is the community edition of the Wattzap Turbo Trainer Software. It is provided "as is" and without support.
